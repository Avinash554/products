Done as part of coding challenge

1. Pushed code to github:  https://github.com/Avinash554/products and one can clone the code from https://github.com/Avinash554/products.git

2. Using github pages in github deployed code so one can view in browser: https://avinash554.github.io/products/

3. Used plugins in one single file plugin.js and css for plugins in plugin.js

4. Made a service call to JSON URL - https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json getting 403 Forbidden error (CORS Issue) but i wrote and commented the code for service call in scripts.js file. I tried to solve but unable to do that so added productsObject and used the json.

5. Added a popup which is responsive and opens respective image when we click on respective image and one can close the popup using close button or on clicking the overlay (outer area of opened dialog)

6. Made Responsive â€“ 3 columns on desktop and ipad pro to 2 columns on ipad to 1 column on mobile

7. Added SEO (Search Engine Optimization) at the top of index.html between <head></head>

8. Added Accessibility (i use NVDA Screen Reader) used tabindex="0" to put everything in tab order and there will be a focus ring in blue color we can see when we click Tab key in keyboard.

9. I can implement Internationalization i18n.

10. Added preloader and there is a top arrow to scroll top from the bottom of web page

11. The project structure is like all the css files under css folder, images under image folder, js files under js folder and index.html
