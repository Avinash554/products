# products
Done as part of coding challenge

1. Pushed code to github:  https://github.com/Avinash554/products

2. Using github pages in github deployed code so one can view in browser: https://avinash554.github.io/products/

3. Used plugins in one single file plugin.js and css for plugins in plugin.js

4. Made a service call to JSON URL - https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json getting 403 Forbidden error (CORS Issue) but i left and commented the code in scripts.js. I tried to solve but unable to do that so added productsObject and used the json
