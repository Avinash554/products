Done as part of coding challenge

1. Pushed code to github:  https://github.com/Avinash554/products and one can clone the code from https://github.com/Avinash554/products.git

2. Using github pages in github deployed code so one can view in browser: https://avinash554.github.io/products/

3. Used plugins in one single file plugin.js and css for plugins in plugin.js

4. Made a service call to JSON URL - https://www.westelm.com/services/catalog/v4/category/shop/new/all-new/index.json getting 403 Forbidden error (CORS Issue) but i wrote and commented the code for service call in scripts.js file. I tried to solve but unable to do that so added productsObject and used the json.

5. Made Responsive â€“ 1 column on mobile to 3 columns on desktop

6. Added Accessibility (i use NVDA Screen Reader)and SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

7. Added preloader and there is a top arrow to scroll top from the bottom of web page

7. The project structure is like all the css files under css folder, images under image folder, js files under js folder and index.html
